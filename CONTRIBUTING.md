# Contributing to Ocean

Thank you for considering contributing to our data integration framework! Your contributions play a crucial role in improving the functionality, scalability, and usability of the framework. This readme aims to explain the difference between contributing to the framework itself and contributing a new integration.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.


## Contributing to the Framework

Contributing to the framework involves actively participating in its development and improvement. By contributing, you can help enhance its core features, fix bugs, optimize performance, and ensure compatibility with various data sources and formats. Here are some ways you can contribute to the framework:

1. **Feature Development**: You can propose and implement new features that align with the framework's objectives. Whether it's introducing advanced data transformation capabilities, supporting new data storage systems, or improving the user interface, your ideas and contributions are valuable.

2. **Bug Fixes**: If you encounter any bugs or issues while using the framework, you can contribute by investigating the problem, identifying the root cause, and submitting fixes. By addressing these issues, you ensure a more stable and reliable framework for all users.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Improving the framework's performance is always a priority. You can contribute by optimizing algorithms, reducing resource usage, and implementing caching mechanisms, resulting in faster and more efficient data integration processes.

4. **Documentation**: Clear and comprehensive documentation is crucial for users to understand and leverage the framework's capabilities. You can help by improving existing documentation, writing new guides, and providing code examples that demonstrate various integration scenarios.

5. **Code Reviews**: Reviewing code submissions from other contributors is an essential part of maintaining code quality. By participating in code reviews, you can provide feedback, suggest improvements, and ensure adherence to coding standards.

## Contributing a New Integration

Apart from contributing to the framework itself, you can also contribute by adding new integrations to expand its compatibility and usefulness. Integrations allow the framework to connect with different data sources, APIs, and services. Here's how you can contribute a new integration:

1. **Integration Proposal**: Start by proposing the integration you would like to add. Provide a clear description of the data source or service, explain how it aligns with the framework's goals, and outline the benefits it would bring to users.

2. **Integration Implementation**: Once your proposal is accepted, you can begin implementing the integration. This involves writing code to establish connections, retrieve data, and handle any necessary authentication or authorization mechanisms.

3. **Testing and Documentation**: Thoroughly test the integration to ensure its reliability and functionality. Additionally, document the integration by providing usage instructions, configuration details, and any specific considerations users should be aware of.

4. **Integration Submission**: Finally, submit your integration code and documentation to the framework's repository for review. Collaborate with other contributors to address feedback and make any necessary improvements. Ensure that the integration is submitted as a `beta` version. This allows for a period of testing and feedback, ensuring that any potential issues can be identified and addressed before the integration is released as GA.

By contributing a new integration, you enable users of the framework to seamlessly integrate with additional data sources and services, expanding its versatility and usefulness.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Create a new change fragment using towncrier. See [here](https://towncrier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#creating-news-fragments) for more information.
   ```bash
    towncrier create --content 'My very important changelog message' <Issue Id / title>.<type (feature / bugfix / etc...)>
    ```

3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one of Port developers.
