## 0.4.12 (2023-12-22)


### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `ocean new` scaffolding error `'collections.OrderedDict object' has no attribute 'public_integration'` (PORT-5728)


## 0.4.11 (2023-12-21)

### Improvements

- Added handling for aggregation properties when initializing the integration, so it will patch the aggregation properties after creating the relations (PORT-5717)

## 0.4.10 (2023-12-21)


### Improvements

- Wrapped the httpx async client with implementation that overrides the default transport class with custom transport to apply all default httpx features that are ignored when passing a custom transport instance. This allows the missing behevior of the http [proxy environment variable](https://www.python-httpx.org/environment_variables/#proxies) (PORT-5676)

### Improvements

- Added a way to create the integration without the Dockerfile and .dockerignore to use the global Docker files when scaffolding a new integration.
